# Contributing
Thank you for wanting to contribute to these lessons. All PRs will need to be approved so please follow the guidelines below.

## Notebook PRs
If you're viewing the notebook on Goole Colaboratory then follow these instructions:
1. Click the **COPY TO DRIVE** button on the toolbar. This will open the notebook on a new tab.
2. Rename this new notebook by removing the words `Copy of` from the title (change "`Copy of 01_Notebooks`" to "`01_Notebooks`").
3. Now you can run the code, make changes, etc. and it's all automatically saved to your personal Google Drive.
4. After making your changes, *Runtime* >> *Restart runtime...* to get rid of executed cell numbers.
5. Then go to *File* >> *Download .ipynb* to download the notebook as an IPython notebook.
6. Create a new branch (with a descriptive name) to submit your change to.
7. Replace the notebook you're making an edit to with the new .ipynb file on your new branch.
8. Submit the PR following the submission guidelines below.

## Submission guidelines
- Keep each PR focused and don't combine different issues into one monolithic PR.

- If you follow the *Notebook PR* instruction above you won't add any additional whitespace. But if you do add any whitespace, please remove it.

- Don't treat a submitted PR as your development environment. If more changes are needed just close the current PR and start a new one.
